# Lab 1

The Lab 1 directory contains my custom startup_mailer.py script when sends me a personalized email to my inbox when the script is run, which happens automatically at startup due to a call to it in the file '/etc/rc.local'. The directory also contains screenshots of the email received from the mailer script, as well as sccreenshot of an active connection from my laptop to the vnc server running on the PI (remote desktop service). <br />

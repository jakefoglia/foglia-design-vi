# Foglia Design VI

This is a repository for ECE 322 - Design VI <br /> <br />

The work contained in this repository is primarily tailored to use with a Raspberry PI, or other Linux machines. <br />
There is also work involving remote connection from my Windows 10 laptop to the Raspberry PI via Secure Shell (SSH) and a remote desktop service (VNC Server).  <br />

# Lab1

The Lab1 directory contains my custom startup_mailer.py script when sends me a personalized email to my inbox when the script is run, which happens automatically at startup due to a call to it in the file '/etc/rc.local'. The directory also contains screenshots of the email received from the mailer script, as well as sccreenshot of an active connection from my laptop to the vnc server running on the PI (remote desktop service). <br />

# Lab2 

The Lab2 directory just contains a screenshot of minicom running on the PI. The rest of the lab I couldn't complete because I do not have access to a breadboard or the other components required. 

# Lab3

The Lab3 directory contains various scripts and screenshots, including Python scripts for querying system info and sending an email.  Additionally I benchmarked some python scripts using time.c. Standard Python seems to be the fasted, followed closely by Python3. PyPy is the slowest environment. I was able to get Doxygen working correctly. Parts B and D I could not complete because I dont have the breadboard and other components. Everything else was completed.

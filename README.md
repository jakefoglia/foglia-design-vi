# Foglia Design VI

This is a repository for ECE 322 - Design VI
The work contained in this repository is primarily tailored to use with a Raspberry PI, or other Linux machines.
There is also work involving remote connection from my Windows 10 laptop to the Raspberry PI via Secure Shell (SSH) and a remote desktop service (VNC Server).  

# Lab 1

The Lab 1 directory contains my custom startup_mailer.py script when sends me a personalized email to my inbox when the script is run, which happens automatically at startup due to a call to it in the file '/etc/rc.local'. The directory also contains screenshots of the email received from the mailer script, as well as sccreenshot of an active connection from my laptop to the vnc server running on the PI (remote desktop seervice).
